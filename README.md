# Sleep-Apnea-Dreem

Project carried by Emile Cohen and Louis Ravillon.

In this repo, we detail the different methods we used to tackle the Data Challenge provided by Ecole Normale Sup√©rieure on the detection of sleep apnea.   Ourmethodology highly relies on the course Time-Series that we followed part of the MVA Master track.  Our approach was to create a scalable testing environmentto be able to easily perform ablation studies with different preprocessing steps,models, hyperparameters etc.
